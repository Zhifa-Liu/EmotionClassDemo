　　Part Ⅱ Reading Comprehension(35 minutes)
　　Directions: There are 4 passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A),B),C)and D). You should decide on the best choice and mark the corresponding letter on the Answer Sheet with a single line through the centre.
　　Passage One
　　Questions 11 to 15 are based on the following passage.
　　The predictability of our mortality rates is something that has long puzzled social scientists. After all, there is no natural reason why 2,500 people should accidentally shoot themselves each year or why 7,000 should drown or 55,000 die in their cars. No one establishes a quota for each type of death. It just happens that they follow a consistent pattern year after year.
　　A few years ago a Canadian psychologist named Gerald Wilde became interested in this phenomenon. He noticed that mortality rates for violent and accidental deaths throughout the Western world have remained oddly static throughout the whole of the century, despite all the technological advances and increases in safety standards that have happened in that time. Wilde developed an intriguing theory called “risk homeostasis”. According to this theory, people instinctively live with a certain level of risk. When something is made safer, people will get around the measure in some way to reassert the original level of danger. If, for instance, they are required to wear seat belts, they will feel safer and thus will drive a little faster and a little more recklessly, thereby statistically canceling out the benefits that the seat belt confers. Other studies have shown that where an intersection is made safer, the accident rate invariably falls there but rises to a compensating level elsewhere along the same stretch of road. It appears, then, that we have an innate need for danger.
　　In all events, it is becoming clearer and clearer to scientists that the factors influencing our lifespan are far more subtle and complex than had been previously thought. It now appears that if you wish to live a long life, it isn’t simply a matter of adhering to certain precautions … eating the right foods, not smoking, driving with care. You must also have the right attitude. Scientists at the Duke University Medical Center made a 15-year study of 500 persons personalities and found, somewhat to their surprise, that people with a suspicious or mistrustful nature die prematurely far more often than people with a sunny disposition. Looking on the bright side, it seems, can add years to your life span.
　　11. What social scientists have long felt puzzled about is why .
　　A) the mortality rate can not be predicted
　　B) the death toll remained stable year after year
　　C) a quota for each type of death has not come into being

　　B) have oddly accounted for mortality rates in the past century
　　C) have reduced mortality rates for violent and accidental deaths
　　D) have achieved no effect in bringing down the number of deaths
　　13. According to the theory of “risk homeostasis”, some traffic accidents result from .
　　A) our innate desire for risk
　　B) our fast and reckless driving
　　C) our ignorance of seat belt benefits
　　D) our instinctive interest in speeding
　　14. By saying “…statistically canceling out the benefits that the seat belt confers” (Para. 2),the author means .
　　A) wearing seat belts does not have any benefits from the statistic point of view
　　B) deaths from wearing seat belts are the same as those from not wearing them
　　C) deaths from other reasons counterbalance the benefits of wearing seat belts
　　D) wearing seat belts does not necessarily reduce deaths from traffic accidents

　　A) Showing adequate trust instead of suspicion of others
　　B) Eating the food low in fat and driving with great care
　　C) Cultivating an optimistic personality and never losing heart
　　D) Looking on the bright side and developing a balanced level of risk
　　Passage Two
　　Questions 16 to 20 are based on the following passage.
　　In California the regulators, the utilities and the governor all want the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to cap spot (现货的) market prices. The Californians claim it will rein in outrageous prices. Federal regulators have refused. The battle is on.
　　Governor Gray Davis says,“I’m not happy with the Federal Regulatory Commission at all. They’re living in an ivory tower. If their bills were going up like the people in San Diego, they would know that this is a real problem in the real world.”
　　As part of deregulation, price caps were removed to allow for a free market. Timing is everything; natural gas prices had already skyrocketed. Demand was high from California’s booming economy. No new power plants had been built here in ten years, and power producers had the right to hike prices along with demand. And hike them they did.
　　Loretta Lynch of the Public Utilities Commission says,” This commission and all of California was beating down the door of federal regulators to say‘help us impose reasonable price caps to help to keep our market stable.”
　　Federal regulators did ask for longer-term contracts between power producers and the utilities to stabilize prices. The federal commission, unavailable for comment on this story, released a recent statement defending its position not to re-regulate.
　　Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Dec. 15,2000: “The commission
